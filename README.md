# Predicting Customer Subcription ANN

The dataset, **Bank Marketing**, is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. The classification goal is to **predict if the client will subscribe** a term deposit. 

Data was recorded from May 2008 to November 2010.
